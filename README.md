# Robut-Uncoil

A Plugin for [Robut](https://github.com/justinweiss/robut) that allows you expand shortened links from the chat window.

## Usage
Since the plugin is still in development, this is the expected behavior:

    user_a  > @robut uncoil http://bit.ly/2EEjBl
    robut   > @user_a that url goes to http://www.cnn.com/ (you asked about http://bit.ly/2EEjBl)
